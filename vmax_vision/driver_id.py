"""Driver attribution ladder.

Knowing that *a* car left the track is worthless to a steward; the question is
always which one. The ladder is deliberately ordered from cheapest and most
reliable to weakest, and reports the highest rung that actually fired along with
what it was based on, so a marginal attribution is visible as marginal rather
than being laundered into a name.

  1. livery      colour signature inside the detected silhouette
  2. continuity  an unbroken track back to a frame where a higher rung fired
  3. lane        which side of the racing line the car has held
  4. sequence    running order along the track, when nothing else separates them

Rung 1 is the only one that identifies a car outright; the rest disambiguate
between candidates already on track, which is what the two-car scenarios need.
